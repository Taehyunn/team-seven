### Pig Dice Game Rules
- Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.
- To play you'll need 2 to 10 players, one 6-sided dice, and a pencil and some paper for keeping score.

#### So how do you play Pig?
- Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn’t roll a 1.
- The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
- If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
- Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

#### How do you win?
- The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.

#### Are there any rule or scoring variations?
##### Two-Dice Pig
- This variant is the same as Pig, except two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends. If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost and their turn ends.

##### Big Pig
- This variant is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except rolling double 1s ends the player’s turn, scores 25 points, and eliminates any other points the player may have accumulated that turn. If any other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.

##### Hog
- This variant is the same as Pig, except the player rolls only once per turn with an arbitrary number of dice.
